# TODO: 2.
#   You should have RUN the  m7e_loopy_turtles  module and READ its code.
#   (Do so now if you have not already done so.)
#  _
#   Below this comment, add ANY CODE THAT YOU WANT, as long as:
#     1. You construct at least 2  rg.SimpleTurtle  objects.
#     2. Each rg.SimpleTurtle object draws something
#          (by moving, using its rg.Pen).  ANYTHING is fine!
#     3. Each rg.SimpleTurtle moves inside a LOOP.
#  _
#   Don't forget that you need to import rosegraphics, construct a TurtleWindow
#   and have it close_on_mouse_click, just as in all previous modules.
#  _
#   In this CHALLENGE problem, be creative!
#   Strive for way-cool pictures!  Abstract pictures rule!
#  _
#   If you make syntax (notational) errors, no worries -- get help
#   fixing them at either this session OR at the NEXT session.
#  _
#   Don't forget to COMMIT-and-PUSH when you are done with this module.
