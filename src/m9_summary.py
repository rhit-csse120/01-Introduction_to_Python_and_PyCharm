# TODO: 2.
#   Write code that accomplishes the following (and ONLY the following),
#   in the order listed:  (IMPORTANT: Write the code for item 1 below
#   and TEST that it works, then write AND TEST items 2-5, then write
#   and TEST the entire program.)
#  _
#    - Constructs a SimpleTurtle with a  "blue"  Pen.
#    - Makes the SimpleTurtle:
#        1. Go straight UP 200 pixels.
#        2. Lift its pen UP
#             (so that the next movements do NOT leave a "trail").
#             HINT: Use the "dot trick" to figure out how to do this.
#        3. Go to the Point at (100, -40).
#             HINT: Use the "dot trick" to figure out how to do this.
#        4. Put its pen DOWN
#             (so that the next movements will return to leaving a "trail").
#        5. Have color "green" and thickness 10.
#        6. Go 150 pixels straight DOWN.
#  _
#   Don't forget to:
#     - Import rosegraphics
#     - Construct a TurtleWindow
#            [remember the required PARENTHESES for constructing an object!]
#         at the BEGINNING of your code.
#     - Ask your  TurtleWindow to   close_on_mouse_click
#          as the LAST line of your code.  (Again, parentheses needed!)
#   See the beginning and end of   m5e_loopy_turtles   for an example.
#  _
#   As always, test by running the module.

# TODO: 3. After you have successfully written and tested code per the above
#   (get help as needed!), be sure that you understand how to:
#     -- CONSTRUCT an INSTANCE of a CLASS (we call such instances OBJECTS).
#     -- Make an object   ** DO **   something by using a METHOD.
#     -- Reference an object's   ** DATA **   by using an INSTANCE VARIABLE.
#  _
#   If those concepts are not clear to you, ASK FOR HELP.
#   Once you understand those concepts, change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
#  _
#   As always, COMMIT-and-PUSH when you are done with this module.
