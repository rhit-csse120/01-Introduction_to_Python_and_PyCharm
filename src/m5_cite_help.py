"""
Do this module WITH (or as directed by) YOUR INSTRUCTOR.
It lets you practice citing help as part of Academic Integrity.

In this course, when you get help on a module from a person(s),
you must CITE the help that you received by listing their names
on the relevant line below (line XXX).  Note that:
  -- It is perfectly OK (indeed, expected!) for you to get help
       from people in working on the modules in this course!
       Conversations are what create a DEEP understanding of the material!
  -- For simplicity, cite any help you get from your another student,
       a course assistant, your instructor, your grandmother -- whatever!
       If in doubt, cite the help.
  -- Your grade is NEVER reduced by citing help.
